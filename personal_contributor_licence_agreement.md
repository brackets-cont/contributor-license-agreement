 # **CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT**

Thank you for Your interest in contributing to Projects made available by "Brackets Community". In order to clarify the rights granted to Brackets Community, Brackets Community must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for Your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its users; it does not change Your rights to use Your own Submissions for any other purpose.

This Agreement version allows an entity to submit Contributions to Brackets Community, authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to Brackets Community, and grant copyright and patent licenses.

Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for Your records.

This CLA is agreed to by the party signing below ("You" or "Your"), and conveys certain license rights to Brackets Community for Your contributions to open source projects.

This CLA is effective as of the latest signature date below.

  ###  1.**DEFINITIONS.**
    
  A. "**You**" (or "**Your**") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Brackets Community.

  B. "**Contribution**" shall mean the code, documentation or other original works of authorship expressly identified, as well as any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that you intentionally submit to Brackets Community for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Brackets Community. For the purposes of this definition, "**submitted**" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Brackets Community or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Brackets Community to discuss and improve the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

  You represent and warrant that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work.

  ###  4. **YOUR EMPLOYER**. 
  References to "employer" in this CLA include Your employer or anyone else for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g., contractor, vendor, or agent. If Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your employer to make the Submission before signing this CLA. In that case, the term "You" in this CLA will refer to You and the employer collectively. Suppose You change employers in the future and desire to Submit additional Submissions for the new employer.

Suppose any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement. In that case, any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
